# Identifying Ad Images
Code to differentiate ad from non-ad images based on the geometry of the image (if available) as well as phrases occurring in the URL, the image's URL and alt text, the anchor text, and words occurring near the anchor text.

## Summary of Strategy and Results

### Strategy

The major challenges to building an accurate model were:  
1. Non-random missing data in the continuous variables
2. A large number of features given the size of the sample (1,558 vs 3,279)
3. The overwhelming majority of the features are sparse
4. There is only a moderate number of observations
5. High class imbalance

I tackled these challenges by:
1. Turning the continuous variables into binary variables where missing values is a feature.
2. Using algorithms robust to unfavorable feature to observation ratios --like random forest which will only use a sample of the features per model fit.
3. Using variance threshold based feature selection and regularized models to avoid using many uninformative sparse features in the model.
4. Avoiding more data-hungre cross-validation strategies like nested cross-validation.
5. Adjusted class weights and used sampling techniques like SMOTE and Tomek Link removal.

### Results

ROC curves on the test data:

![alt text](https://github.com/jcharit1/Identifying-Ad-Images/blob/master/plots/ROC_Best.png "AUC ROC on Test Data of Best Models")

The above strategies resulted in highly predictive models. The best iteration of each model explored had an average AUC ROC greater than 0.95. The best model was the logistic classifier with a 1:1 class weight, the feature variance threshold set to drop zero variance features, and no sampling-based class imbalance corrections. 

The performance of the best model was highly stable. The standard deviation of the validation fold AUC ROC was 0.012. 

The most importance features in the dataset seemed reasonable. Listed in order of importance (identified using random forest), the top five are:
1. ancurl*adclick
2. ancurl*adid
3. origurl*misfits2
4. url*static.wired.com
5. ancurl*http+www

3 out of 5 of these features seem to be add attributes and two seem to be the url of the owners of the data. 

Many more model training approaches were not used. For example, only L2 (Ridge) regularization was used for the logistic classifier and SVM were not used to save time on training. However, since the first iteration of training yielded models with AUC ROC of 0.99, further refinement of the model training process seemed unnecessary.

## Installing

Uses Python 3.5 and anaconda

### Linux 
1. Change into the directory where you want to place the repo
2. Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/jcharit1/Identifying-Ad-Images.git`
3. Change into repo directory: `cd Identifying-Ad-Images/`
4. Edit the environment file prefix (at the end) to reflect your anaconda directory
4. Copy the environment
	1. Option 1, partially copy the environment: `conda env create -f environment_lite.yml`
	2. Option 2, copy the full environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
5. Use environment: `source activate Jimmy_Charite_py35`
6. Make the script executable: `chmod +x ./code/predict_image_type.py`
7. Define the following file paths via bash variables:
	1. path_old_data
	2. path_colnames _use the file in the ./raw_data/ subdirectory of the repo_
	3. path_new_data
	4. path_pred_file
8. Run the script: `./code/predict_image_type.py $path_old_data $path_colnames $path_new_data $path_pred_file`

Copying the full python environment will take 10-15 minutes on a slow internet connection. However, OS specifics aside, it will get you a full mirror of my python environment. Then you should be able run all the notebooks and scripts with, hopefully, no errors. The limited environment (environment_lite.yml) should be sufficient for running the prediction script.

### Windows
